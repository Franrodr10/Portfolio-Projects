Data cleaning and transformation tasks are efficiently executed using Power Query, ensuring the data is prepared for analysis.
The subsequent step involves modeling data using the Star Schema in Power BI. This schema enables a structured and optimized approach to building data models,
enhancing performance and analysis capabilities. Once the model is in place, Power BI is leveraged to create interactive and insightful dashboards, making data
visualization and exploration a seamless process. This integrated approach results in a streamlined and robust data analytics pipeline, improving overall data quality and analysis efficiency.
